## Overview

A workflow optimization for data science project creations. The contained files are my standard files that I include in the majority of the projects and applications I create/develop/manage.

## Usage

Copy and paste the files in the `admin_docs/` directory into a repository of your choice. The only file that needs manual input is to change the [gitignore](gitignore.md) file. Rename this file from `gitignore.md` to `.gitignore` for Github to recognize the ignored file extensions and delete the original file as it is no longer needed.
